# HTidal Beta
Unofficial Tidal client for Linux using tidalapi, Python3 and GTK3

**Currently the whole program is being rewritten, so new features will be delayed until 0.2.**

**Features:**

    -> Log in and remember password (with system keyring)
    -> Play user playlists (album cover in expanded mode, automatically play next track)
    -> Standard media controls (play, pause, next, previous, shuffle)
    -> Karaoke window Experimental (database is extremely small, you can submit requests)
    -> Sort playqueue by drag & drop, artist, title or ID
    -> Download tracks, albums, playlists or playqueue (alac or m4a)
    -> Manage playlists (add/delete items, add/delete playlists)
    -> Manage favourites (add/delete items)
    -> Easy navigation with popovers between artists, albums and tracks
    -> Search the whole Tidal database
    -> Get similar content (albums, artists, radio)

**Note:** Currently the program is in active development, so for example the homescreen is far from ready and you may encounter some minor bugs.
